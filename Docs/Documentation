##Scrap:
# Resolution:
I created a PyPI module for this reason:

pip install screeninfo

The code:

from screeninfo import get_monitors
for m in get_monitors():
    print(str(m))

Result:

monitor(1920x1080+1920+0)
monitor(1920x1080+0+0)

It supports multi monitor environments. Its goal is to be cross platform; for now it supports Cygwin and X11 but pull requests are totally welcome.
